# Base theme class - coauthors-plus

This extension manages settings for the Coauthors+ package and it's
use in Base Theme Class based websites. It is in two parts:

1. Extends the ability to add multiple authors to POSTs, to enable
multiple authors to be assigned to any of the Base Theme Class
custom objects created.

2. Adds a configuration option to specify who can add additional
authors to any page or object. Whether it has to be:

  * an administrator,
  * the owner (first author) of the page/object, or 
  * any of the authors.

## Note:

This plugin in is an extension plugin to Base Theme Class, and so
requires that to be installed along with either Advanced Custom
Fields (ACF) or Advanced Custom Fields Pro (ACFpro).

As this extension manages Co-Authors+ settings then that will
also need to be installed.

## Usage:

You will find the configuration options on the type of user that
can add/remove authors is in Appearance -> Customize ->
Base Theme Class settings.
